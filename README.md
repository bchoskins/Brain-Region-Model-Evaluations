***Abstract***

Neuroimaging research has begun adopting deep learning to model structural differences in the brain. This is a break from previous approaches that rely on derived features from brain MRI, such as regional thicknesses or volumes. To date, most studies  employ  either  deep  learning  based  models  or  traditional  machine  learning  volume  based  models.   Because  of this split, it is unclear which approach is yielding better predictive performance or if the two approaches will lead to different neuroanatomical  conclusions,  potentially  even  when applied to the same datasets.  In the present study, we carry out the largest single study of sex differences in the brain using 21,390 UK Biobank T1-weighted brain MRIs analyzed through both traditional and 3D convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) models.   Through  comparing  performances,  we find that 3D-CNNs, which derive 20 deep learning brain features, out perform traditional machine learning models using 20 brain region volumes as features.  Through comparing regions highlighted by both approaches, we find good internal consistency  between  traditional  machine  learning  and  deep learning models, but poor overlap between these approaches. In summary, we  find that 3D-CNNs  show  exceptional  predictive performance, but may highlight neuroanatomical regions different from what would be found by volume-based approaches
