# Brain-Region-Model-Evaluations



***ABSTRACT***
Neuroimaging research has begun adopting deep learning tomodel structural differences in the brain. This is a break fromprevious approaches that rely on derived features from brainMRI, such as regional thicknesses or volumes. To date, moststudies  employ  either  deep  learning  based  models  or  tradi-tional  machine  learning  volume  based  models.   Because  ofthis split, it is unclear which approach is yielding better pre-dictive performance or if the two approaches will lead to dif-ferent  neuroanatomical  conclusions,  potentially  even  whenapplied to the same datasets.  In the present study, we carryout the largest single study of sex differences in the brain us-ing 21,390 UK Biobank T1-weighted brain MRIs analyzedthrough both traditional and 3D convolutional neural network(3D-CNN)  models.   Through  comparing  performances,  wefind that 3D-CNNs, which derive 20 deep learning brain fea-tures, outperform traditional machine learning models using20 brain region volumes as features.  Through comparing re-gions highlighted by both approaches, we find good internalconsistency  between  traditional  machine  learning  and  deeplearning models, but poor overlap between these approaches.In  summary,  we  find  that  3D-CNNs  show  exceptional  pre-dictive performance, but may highlight neuroanatomical re-gions different from what would be found by volume-basedapproaches
